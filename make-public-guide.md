# üåç Make Repository Public for Easier Deployment

## Option 1: Make GitHub Repository Public

This is the **easiest solution** - no authentication needed!

### Steps:
1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/JugoBonito/flashcard
2. Click **Settings** (tab at the top)
3. Scroll down to **Danger Zone**
4. Click **Change repository visibility**
5. Select **Make public**
6. Type `JugoBonito/flashcard` to confirm
7. Click **I understand, change repository visibility**

### Benefits:
- ‚úÖ No authentication needed in Portainer
- ‚úÖ Anyone can deploy your flashcard app
- ‚úÖ Docker image becomes public automatically
- ‚úÖ Easier to share and contribute

### After making it public:
The Portainer stack will work immediately without any authentication setup!

## Option 2: Keep Private + Use Authentication

If you prefer to keep the repository private, follow the authentication setup in `portainer-auth-setup.md`.

## Recommendation

**Make it public** - FlashCard Pro is a useful open-source application that others might want to use too! Plus it makes deployment much simpler.
